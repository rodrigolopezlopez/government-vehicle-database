üìù Summary:
A government vehicle management system developed using Oracle Database to track vehicle registration, licensing, tax payments, emissions, and ownership history. It includes automatic compliance monitoring, real-time emissions tracking, and penalty enforcement for violations.

The system notifies owners of expired licenses, unpaid taxes, and failed emissions tests, ensuring timely action. It also supports dual-use vehicles (private & commercial) and maintains a history of ownership and infractions. This solution modernizes vehicle control, enhancing compliance and transparency.
